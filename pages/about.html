            <section>
                <p>We are a 20 acre farm and homestead located off of Bach Road here in Wadsworth focused on growing various kinds of fruit trees and berries, with a focus on apples and blueberries.</p>
                
                <p>We host pick your own operations in the late spring and summer where you are welcome to come pick apples, blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries but also have an online store where you can submit online & pickup orders for produce, plant starters, and some of our various garden & livestock products.</p>
                
                <p>We never spray any sort of pesticides or chemicals on our fields, and any treatments we do use are organic and eco-friendly. Our apples may not look the prettiest, but they are every bit as tasty.</p>
                
                <p>Whatever is not sold at the end of the season goes to our animals! Whether that be chickens, pigs, fish, or black soldier flies, nothing goes to waste.</p>

                <h2>Our Heritage</h2>
                <p>We come from a background of christmas tree farming, starting all the way back in the 1950s with Frank Bell and his 40 Acre tree farm in Cuyahoga Valley. Our farm was established by John Pfahl and used to be called Pfahl Nursery where we sold and planted scotch, pine, and spruce trees for christmas and landscaping. John hand planted a lot of trees around Wadsworth and Sharon Center - if you see a tall conifer around here, chances are it was planted by him. Early 2020's we decided that it was time we started using our land to produce things people could eat, and quickly decided on fruit. We are still in the process of clearing and fully planting today.</p>

                    <h3>Brendan Pfahl</h3>
                    <p>The in-house software engineer and creator of this website. I graduated from OSU in 2025 and enjoy all things tech. I make little automation trinkets that we use around the farm - ranging from indoor greenhouse systems that we use for all our plant starters to the automatic door on our chicken coop. I also build and fly my own FPV drones, some videos of which I upload on my <a href =https://www.youtube.com/@HeliumJ66> youtube channel</a>. When I'm not working out on the farm or have my nose buried in VScode, I am cutting my teeth as a software engineer at Honda - developing new technologies for a better future. </p>
