About us:
    We are a 20 acre farm and homestead located off of bach road focused on growing various kinds of fruit trees and berries, with a focus on apples and blueberries. We regularly host pick your own operations in the late spring and summer where you are welcome to come pick apples, blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries. 

    Pick Your Own apples & Cider: You can choose to have some (or all) of your apples pressed into cider right in front of you with our in-house cider press. 
        Note: You can pick what kind of blend your cider has, feel free to grab some of our dolgo & roberts apples for a deep red, tart bodied cider.

    We never spray any sort of pesticides or chemicals on our fields, and any treatments we do use are organic and eco-friendly. Our apples may not look the prettiest, but they are every bit as tasty.


    Our Heritage 
        We come from a background of christmas tree farming, starting all the way back in the 1950s with Frank Bell and his 40 Acre tree farm in cuyahoga valley. Our farm was established by John Pfahl and used to be called Pfahl Nursery where we sold and planted scotch, pine, and spruce trees. John hand planted a lot of trees around Wadsworth and the square, if you see a tall conifer around here, chances are it was planted by John.
